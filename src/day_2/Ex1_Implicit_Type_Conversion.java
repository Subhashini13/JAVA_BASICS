 * Implicit Type Conversion is also known as Widening conversion. It happens in the below scenarios: 

When a value of a data type with smaller range isâ€¯assigned to a variable of a compatible data type with larger range. 

When two variables of different data types are involved in an expression, the value of smaller range datatype is converted to a value of larger range datatype and then the operation is performed.
